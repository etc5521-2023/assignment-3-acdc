## Introduction

The *Ptilotus calostachyus F.Muell*, which is also known as the
**Weeping Mulla Mulla**, is an endemic plant that is commonly found in
the Western Australia territory (Florabase n. d.). This species thrives
in arid region, particular in sandy habitats with red and stony
plains(1). Being a *perennial* plant, it can live up to more than two
years with the seasonal pattern of being dormant in the winter and
sprouting again in springtime - (1). Moreover, **Weeping Mulla Mulla**
displays erect or spreading, herb or shrub characteristics, meaning that
it can be found as a tall plant and/or covering an area, as well as
with/without a woody body. They can grow from 0.2 to 2 meters tall with
pink-white flowers, blooming from March to October. Despite the
widespread of its coverage, there are little to none organized sighting
campaign of the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** due to the outback nature of its
habitat and lesser popularity as compared to other iconic Australia
ecotourism species.

Five expectations when exploring the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** sighting:

-   We expect most of the sightings to occur between March to October.

-   We expect most of the sighting location to be in the Western
    Australia territory.

-   We expect the sightings to be consistent numbers of sightings with
    an increasing trend as sighting/reporting/monitoring methods become
    better. However, this anticipation will exclude years during the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Since the data relies on human observation, there
    may be fewer sightings due to a lack of reporting.

-   We expect the sightings to be clustered in areas with a water source
    as the plant prefers harsh, dry, and hot sandy habitats.

-   We expect the sightings records to increase after rainfall events,
    as plants typically begin to bloom after wet season, which is around
    June - August for Perth.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the **Weeping
Mulla Mulla**, utilising primary data sources from the ALA Atlas of
Living Australia and the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)
database.

Throughout this exploration of expectations, numerous intriguing
observations were uncovered that were not initially anticipated.
Notably, the employment of `spData` and `leaflet` effectively visualised
these findings.

Several limitations have impacted the final analysis. Firstly, there is
a scarcity of observations, primarily because this plant is not commonly
sought after or reported by individuals. Secondly, the absence of
weather recordings in remote areas may result in gaps in the dataset.
Additionally, extrapolating weather data from one region to the entire
species range, instead of relying on the actual weather conditions
recorded in each area, could introduce inaccuracies into the analysis.

## Data description

```{=html}
<!--
2. Download all the occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia, ideally scripted using the `atlas_occurrences()` function from the `galah` package. Make sure you include date, time, collector identification details. Save this into a `data-raw` folder in your repo.
-->
```
### Species data

Below is the code to download the raw data directly from the [Atlas of
Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/).

The basis of record was filtered to `HUMAN_OBSERVATION` only. This
decision was made because we intended to focus solely on sightings of
the species in the wild, and differentiate between specimens that were
preserved, collected samples, or in controlled environments such as
museums.

We have also checked the `BASIS_OF_RECORD_INVALID` to determine the
reliability of each observation, in which all the `TRUE` results were
removed in the process of sub-setting `HUMAN_OBSERVATION` entry in the
`basisOfRecord`.

The other options, such as `LIVING SPECIMEN`, could imply captivity or
control, `PRESERVED SPECIMEN` typically refers to non-living specimens,
and `OCCURRENCE` was too general to confirm its wild state.

```{r raw-data, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
galah_config(email = "mpha0054@student.monash.edu",
             download_reason_id = 10, 
             verbose = TRUE)

raw_data <- ala_occurrences(
  taxa = select_taxa("Ptilotus calostachyus"))

save(raw_data, file = "data-raw/raw_data.rda")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
galah_config(email = "mpha0054@student.monash.edu",
             download_reason_id = 10, 
             verbose = TRUE)

storage <- galah_call() %>%
  galah_identify("Weeping mulla mulla") %>%
  galah_select(
    basisOfRecord, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, eventDate, scientificName,
    taxonConceptID, recordID, dataResourceName, eventRemarks, eventTime, eventID,
    eventDate, samplingEffort, samplingProtocol, cl959,
    group = c("basic", "event")
  ) %>%
  atlas_occurrences() %>%
  filter(basisOfRecord == "HUMAN_OBSERVATION")
```

The data obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia website combines
information from multiple sources and includes various variables such as
location, date, time, scientific names, resource names, species status,
and more. The raw data set contains `r nrow(storage)` observations and
`r ncol(storage)` variables.

For the analysis, the data is filtered to primarily focus on utilising
the location and event time data. This is because the other variables do
not contribute significantly to meaningful insights. However, a
comprehensive dictionary of all the variables is provided below:

```{r data-dictionary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dictionary <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("decimalLatitude", "decimalLongitude", "eventDate", "scientificName", "taxonConceptID", "recordID", "dataResourceName",  "occurrenceStatus", "eventRemarks", "eventTime", "eventID", "samplingEffort", "samplingProtocol", "basisOfRecord", "cl959"),
  Description = c(
    "Latitude value of sighting in decimal format.",
    "Longitude value of sighting in decimal format.",
    "Recorded sighting date and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD, hh:mm:ss. In some cases, no time was recorded, and therefore, it is left as 00:00:00.",
    "The scientific name of the observed species.",
    "The taxonomy website ID: [Ptilotus calostachyus](https://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2910906).",
    "The record ID of each observation.",
    "The data resource associated with the observation: [List of 23 partners](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2910906#data-partners).",
    "The occurrence status: Present.",
    "Any additional remarks or comments related to the observation.",
    "Time of the event recorded in the format hh:mm:ss, including the time zone difference.",
    "The event ID of each obsercation.",
    "A description of the effort or area that was surveyed or sampled to locate the species.",
    "The protocol that was used to sample the species.",
    "Indicates how the record was made: Human observation.",
    "Denotes the local government area where the observation was made."
  )
)

kable(dictionary, format = "markdown")
```

```{r species-data-cleaning}
weeping_mulla_mulla <- storage %>%
  select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, eventDate, cl959) %>%
  rename(longitude = decimalLongitude,
         latitude = decimalLatitude,
         lga = cl959) %>%
  mutate(
    eventDate = as.Date(eventDate),
    Year = lubridate::year(eventDate),
    Month = lubridate::month(eventDate),
    monthName = lubridate::month(eventDate, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),
    Day = lubridate::day(eventDate),
    lga = str_remove(lga, "\\(.*")
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(eventDate)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(longitude)) 
save(weeping_mulla_mulla, file = ("data/weeping_mulla_mulla.rda"))
```

### Weather data

#### **Obtaining weather station data**

The distribution of the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** commonly spans the local
government areas (LGAs) of Ashburton, Broome, Derby-West Kimberley, East
Pilbara, Halls Creek, Karratha, Laverton, Meekatharra, Ngaanyatjarraku,
Port Hedland, Upper Gascoyne, and Wyndham-East Kimberley, as per
findings from
([Florabase](https://florabase.dbca.wa.gov.au/browse/profile.php/2704)).

Since weather is an important factor in the occurrences of species, the
Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) database contains weather
station data that are useful for analysing trends in weather patterns
and precipitation. Obtaining the data via the `rnoaa` package for
Australia was completed using the code below:

```{r weather-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rnoaa)
aus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>
  filter(str_starts(id, "ASN")) |>
  filter(last_year >= 2020) |> 
  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),
         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |>
  filter(element %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) |>
  nest(element: last_year) |>
  rowwise() |>
  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>
  select(-data) 
```

Next, when filtering the weather stations to be within the vicinity of
**Weeping Mulla Mulla**, it becomes evident that the **Weeping Mulla
Mulla** is found in the vicinity of 42 weather stations.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
range(weeping_mulla_mulla$longitude)
range(weeping_mulla_mulla$latitude)

aus_stations_filtered <- aus_stations %>% 
  filter(115.6102 <= longitude & longitude <= 137.1930,
         -24.92637 <= latitude & latitude <= -15.14837)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(world, package = "spData")
australia <- world[world$iso_a2 == "AU", ]

australia_plot <- ggplot(australia) + geom_sf(fill = "#f3edd7")

combined_plot <- australia_plot +
  geom_point(data = weeping_mulla_mulla,
             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude),
             colour = "#c599b2", alpha= 0.3, size = 2.5) +
  labs(title = "Weeping Mulla Mulla Sightings and Weather Stations", 
       x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude", 
       subtitle = "1987 - Present") +
  theme_minimal()

combined_plot +
  geom_point(
    data = aus_stations_filtered,
    aes(
      x = longitude,
      y = latitude,
      color = name == "tennant creek airport"
    ),
    shape = 2
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "#222233", "TRUE" = "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
weeping_mulla_mulla %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.DeLorme") %>%
  setView(lat = -21.833, lng = 128.583, zoom = 5) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude,  
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 0.1,
                   color = "#c599b2",
                   radius = 10) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = aus_stations_filtered,  
                   lng = ~longitude,
                   lat = ~latitude,
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 1,  
                   color = "#222233",      
                   radius = 3) %>% 
   addCircleMarkers(data = aus_stations_filtered %>% filter(name == "tennant creek airport"),
                   lng = ~longitude,
                   lat = ~latitude,
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 1,  
                   color = "red",      
                   radius = 5)
```

The triangles on the map represent the locations of 42 weather stations.
The purple points, with varying alpha and size settings, help to
identify the areas with the highest occurrence rates. Notably, the white
triangle represents the Tennant Creek Airport weather station, which
records the majority of observations. Given this focus, the analysis can
be narrowed down by filtering the weather station data specifically for
Tennant Creek.

#### **Obtaining weather data for Tennant Creek**

The code for obtaining precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum
temperature data for the town is provided below:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tennant_creek_airport <- aus_stations |>
  filter(id == "ASN00015135") |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(
    monitors = id, var = c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN"),
    date_min = "2004-01-01",
    date_max = "2023-09-13") |>
      select(-id))) |>
  rename(lat = latitude, long = longitude, elev = elevation) |> 
  select(id, long, lat, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %>%
  unnest(ts) |>
  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)
```

**Tennant Creek in Barkly Region**

The `weeping_mulla_mulla` dataset has included local government
information. Given that Tennant Creek is situated in the local
government area of Barkly, the final step involves integrating the
species data set with temperature data from weather stations and
highlighting those observations belonging to the Barkly region.

A new column named `sighting` is created. This column serves the crucial
purpose of indicating whether a sighting occurred on a particular day or
not and whether temperature data is available. Consequently, as all the
observations within the Barkly region have corresponding temperature
data, a comprehensive dataset can be generated that encompasses both
observational data and daily weather information.

```{r}
temperature <- tennant_creek_airport %>%
  left_join(weeping_mulla_mulla, by = c("date" = "eventDate")) %>%
  select(date:Day) %>% 
  mutate(sighting = ifelse(lga == "Barkly ", 1, 0))

save(temperature, file = ("data/temperature.rda"))
```

## Initial data analysis

```{=html}
<!--
3. Perform a data quality check, and then go ahead and clean the data, saving only the wild sightings. Save the resulting data in a `data` folder as an `WILD_THING_COMMON_NAME.rda` file, so that any special variable types are clearly available. (Replace `WILD_THING_COMMON_NAME` with lower case common name of your assigned wild thing.) *Note:* Some are museum or historical records or live in an animal sanctuary or zoo, which do not truly capture their wild behaviour. Downloading the event information (`galah_select(group = "event")`) can help identify wild sightings.

Weather data pre-processing here too.
-->
```
### Checking data quality

We will be using `visdat` library to check for data type errors

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(visdat)

vis_dat(weeping_mulla_mulla)
```

**Discussion** The result of `visdat` does not signify any anomalies
that needed to be addressed before proceeding with further analysis.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vis_guess(weeping_mulla_mulla)
```

**Discussion** `vis_guess` shows that the *longitude* and *latitude*
columns both have a record with potentially integer coordinates entry.
While this is a sign of rounding given that the coordinates span from a
length of values with 5 decimal places precision, we believe this value
does not need any alterations as sighting coordinates span across a very
wide geographical area, making rounding to the nearest whole number (1.0
degree is 111 kilometers) insignificant in our spatial analysis.

## Exploratory data analysis

### Spatial expectation

To evaluate the spatial distribution of the species, a method involving
the use of a map to pinpoint locations was employed. This was achieved
by utilising the `spData` package in conjunction with its `world` data.

The initial expectation was that the majority of sightings would be
concentrated in Western Australia.

The map displaying the sightings below validates the initial hypothesis.
However, it also reveals a significant number of sightings in the
Northern Territory.

Most of the sightings are clustered in the northern regions of Western
Australia, aligning with expectations. Notably, there are no sightings
in the southern areas of Western Australia, including the city of Perth.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(world, package = "spData")
australia <- world[world$iso_a2 == "AU", ]

australia_plot <- ggplot(australia) + geom_sf(fill = "#f3edd7") 

combined_plot <- australia_plot +
  geom_point(data = weeping_mulla_mulla,
             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude),
             colour = "#c599b2") +
  labs(title = "Weeping Mulla Mulla Sightings Across Australia", 
       x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude", 
       subtitle = "1987 - Present") +
  theme_minimal()

combined_plot
```

### Temporal expectation

To assess the temporal occurrences of the species, the same method of
using a map to pinpoint locations was employed. However, an additional
step was introduced, involving the segmentation of the data by month to
distribute the results throughout the year.

The initial expectation was that the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** would
exhibit a higher frequency of observations from March to October.

The map displaying the sightings by month validates this initial
hypothesis, as there are fewer data points on the map in January and
February, as well as in November and December.

Interestingly, a new insight emerges when the data is segmented by
month. The previous map showed the regions where observations were most
frequent, namely Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Now, when
the data is subset by month, it becomes apparent that these two regions
remain the primary clusters.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
combined_plot +
  facet_wrap(~monthName, ncol = 6) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Weeping Mulla Mulla Sightings By Month")
```

To test the validity of our visual inference, we decided to employ
`nullabor` null plots. Our hypotheses are as follows:

-   $H_0:$ There is no difference in the distribution of geographical
    points between the "Active" months and the "Others" months.
-   $H_1:$ There is a difference in the distribution of geographical
    points between the "Active" months and the "Others" months.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(20190709)

custom_weep <- weeping_mulla_mulla

custom_weep$Month <- ifelse(custom_weep$Month >= 3 & custom_weep$Month <= 10, "Active", "Others")

data(world, package = "spData")
australia <- world[world$iso_a2 == "AU", ]

australia_plot <- ggplot(australia) + geom_sf(fill = "#f3edd7") 

combined_plot <- australia_plot +
  geom_point(data = lineup(null_permute('Month'), custom_weep),
             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, col = Month)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(110 , 145 ), ylim = c(-10, -30)) +
  facet_wrap(~.sample, ncol=5) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour="black"),
        legend.position = "None")

combined_plot
```

We have given the null plots to around 14 friends and only one of them
picked the true plot at 16. This equates to the p-values below:

```{r}
pvisual(1,14,20)
```

`x simulated` shows 0.4612 and `binom` shows 0.512325 - both are above
the threshold 0.05, which means that we reject the null hypothesis in
favor of the alternative hypothesis. Consequently, we are 95% confident
that the selection of the true plot is by chance and there is an
association between the combinations of `longitude` and `latitude` for
different `Month` periods ("*Active*" and "*Others*").

### Trend expectation

Since the data relies on human observation, it was anticipated that
there might have been fewer sightings due to a lack of reporting.

By employing a simple method of plotting the number of observations
against the years using a histogram, it can be seen that there was no
indication of reduced observations during the COVID-19 years from 2000
to 2021. In fact, 2021 recorded the second-highest number of
observations for the species.

Nevertheless, an interesting new observation stands out - a significant
spike in sightings occurred in 2015. This spike was the highest,
surpassing even the sightings in 2021, with 108 observations compared to
34, which is more than three times as many.

Currently, there are no findings that can explain this phenomenon. Given that the years after 2015 usually saw much higher reported sightings as compared to the previous, we hypothesize that this effect is due to the proliferation of internet-of-things, allowing sightings to be reported with greater ease and more reliable reporting platforms/databanks. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning =FALSE}
weeping_mulla_mulla %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  count() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n, fill = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("2020" = "#c599b2", "2021" = "#c599b2")) +
  labs(
    title = "Weeping Mulla Mulla Observations by Year",
    y = "Number of observations"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", legend.title = element_blank())
```

### Seasonality expectation

To test whether our expectation that the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** becomes
more active after rainfall seasons is accurate, we decided to plot the
occurrences by month. While there are some indications from the previous
*Temporal expectation* section, where June to August plots show
considerably more observation points, we would like create a bar plot
for a better visualization inference.

```{r}
weeping_mulla_mulla %>%
  group_by(monthName) %>%
  count() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = monthName, y = n, fill = as.factor(monthName))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Jun" = "#c599b2", 
                               "Jul" = "#c599b2", 
                               "Aug" = "#c599b2")) +
  labs(
    title = "Weeping Mulla Mulla Observations by Month",
    y = "Number of observations",
    x = "Month"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", legend.title = element_blank())
```

Interestingly, we observe decreased sightings during June and July while
August has the highest sighting occurrences. March marks the start of
the blooming cycle with April and May being the autumn season in Western
Australia (Tourism Australia n. d.), which has occasional showers. This
explains the large rise in sightings for these months. However, the main
raining events (June to August) saw significantly lower occurrences - we
believe this is due to thunderstorms and flooding, preventing casual
observers to stumble upon these plants. Only August has high sighting
occurrences, as the end of winter has milder downpours.

### Habitat expectation

Given that the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** prefers stony and sandy
environments, we expect the plants to be sighted near areas with
freshwater such as river banks,... Moreover, observations by travelers
might be more likely to be located near and/or on the way to a water
source. To test our this expectation, we deploy a `leaflet` map, which
displays geographical features such as subsurface water, creeks, lakes,
and rivers.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

weeping_mulla_mulla %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.DeLorme") %>%
  setView(lat = -21.833, lng = 128.583, zoom = 5) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude,  
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 0.1, 
                   color = "#5b9b2e"
)
```

Due to the zoom level, we could not see the water body features of the
map; Therefore, we decided to investigate a cluster of sightings near
Ali Curung.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

weeping_mulla_mulla %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.DeLorme") %>%
  setView(lat = -20.9358, lng = 134.2996, zoom = 10) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude,  
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 0.5, 
                   color = "#5b9b2e"
) 
```

Based on the map above, we can see that the main cluster of **Weeping
Mulla Mulla** does not live near a water source, which is different from
what we expected. This suggests that the plant is dependent on rain,
meaning that high precipitation periods might lead to higher sightings.
It is also interesting to see that these sightings were near the
National 87 road, implying that these reports were made by passersby.

### Precipitation and sighting annually

```{r echo=FALSE}
average_precipitation <- temperature %>%
  mutate(Year = lubridate::year(date)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(total_prcp = sum(prcp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(avg_prcp = total_prcp / 365)
  

rainplot <- temperature %>%
  filter(sighting == 1) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(sighting_count = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = sighting_count), stat = "identity", fill = "aquamarine4") +
  geom_line(data = average_precipitation, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = avg_prcp, group = 1), color = "#c599b2", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(data = average_precipitation, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = avg_prcp), color = "#c599b2") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Sighting Count",
       title = "Sighting Count and Average Precipitation by Year \n(Barkly and Tennant Creek Station)",

From the figure above, we can see there are multiple gaps in the sighting of the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** from 2004 to 2023. This inconsistency can be explained by the lack of popularity of our plant species. As addressed above in the **Trend expectation** section, 2015 saw an abnormally high sighting count, despite a normal annual average precipitation figure for that year, especially when there were no sighting records in 2013-2014. 
We can hypothesize a delayed effect of plant sightings where years with decreasing rainfall will be accompanied by sightings when the annual average precipitation begins to trend upward. For instance, 2006 - 2007 saw a decreasing trend in rainfall without any plant sightings; However, 2008 saw new reported sightings, as well as the start of increasing precipitation trend from 2008 to 2011. Another example is when the downward trend from 2011 to 2013 saw dwindling sightings with increasing rainfall but from 2015 onwards, sightings were much higher and there were fewer gaps in annual sightings. Perhaps this is due to preference for dry weather of the plants; therefore, decreasing precips allow the **Weeping Mulla Mulla** to thrive better in constrast to being overwatered in wetter years. 

### Temperature and sightings

```{r}
temperature$date <- as.Date(temperature$date)

monthly_avg <- temperature %>%
  mutate(month = format(date, "%Y-%m")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(avg_tmax = mean(tmax), avg_tmin = mean(tmin))

tempt_plot <- ggplot(monthly_avg, aes(x = as.Date(paste0(month, "-01")))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_tmax, color = "Hot Temperature"), size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_tmin, color = "Cold Temperature"), size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Hot Temperature" = "#FF0000", "Cold Temperature" = "#0000FF")) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Temperature",
       title = "Monthly Average Maximum and Minimum Temperature",
       color = "Temperature") +
  theme_minimal()
